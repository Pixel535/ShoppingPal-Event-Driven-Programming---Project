# ShoppingPal - Project
The project was done as part of the Event Driven Programming course for the Military University of Technology

# Description
ShoppingPal is a desktop application that allows users to create their own shopping lists. 
Users can create and delete their own lists, add or remove their own products to them or search for products from the Open Food Facts API. 
The lists are saved in a MongoDB database so when the app is closed and restarted, all the lists that the user has created will still be saved. 
In addition, the application calculates how much shopping will cost more or less based on such a list. It was written in Java and the GUI was designed in Scene Builder.
The whole application meets the requirements of the Scorecard, such as multithreading, asynchronous programming, having Config Properties and many others, 
which are described in detail in the Report.

# Getting started
